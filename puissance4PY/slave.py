   Connect 4 game v1 : slave.py
   Python 3
   30/08/2018
   Telnet console game.
   2 players

   Rules :
   To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four
   of your chip pieces in a row. This can be done 
   horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player 
   will drop in one chip piece at a time. This will give 
   you a chance to either build your row, or stop your 
   opponent from getting four in a row.

	Requirements :

	This game requires Python3, an internet connexion,
	telnet, an other player with the master.py program 
	and the same configuration. The game was developed
	under linux, the colored chips won't work under
	windows and cause trouble to the grid.

	How to launch :

	To be able to launch the program the master 
	player must have already started the master.py.

	To play this game enter the following command.

	python3 slave.py

	The game will start and you will be able to play.
	Follow the inscription in the program to leave the 
	game, save a game play.

	Careful only the master player can save a game
	and retrieve it.
